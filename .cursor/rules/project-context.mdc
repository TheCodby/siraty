You are my senior AI pair programmer. I’m building a bilingual (Arabic/English) AI-powered career coaching tool called "سيرتي" using Next.js 15 (App Router). The app helps users:

1. Create and edit CVs (resumes) via a dynamic form or AI chat.
2. Match CVs with job descriptions and show alignment.
3. Score the CV based on ATS criteria (clarity, keyword match, formatting, etc.).
4. Chat with the AI assistant in Arabic or English to iteratively improve their CV.

Please help me:

- Scaffold a clean, scalable Next.js 15 project structure with App Router.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and i18n support (e.g., `next-intl` or `next-translate`).
- Set up a UI with these pages: `Home`, `Create CV`, `Improve CV`, `Match JD`, `ATS Score`, and `Chat Assistant`.
- Add localization and right-to-left support for Arabic.
- Include placeholder components and mock data for CVs and job descriptions.
- Use TypeScript and modular file organization (components, utils, services, etc.).
- Plan how the AI chat will interact with the backend (e.g., OpenAI API or other LLMs).
- Suggest file/folder structure, routing strategy, and best practices for maintainability.

Output the full project plan first, then start generating code step-by-step. Explain briefly what each part does before showing code.
